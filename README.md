# SQL-INJECTION-DETECTION-AND-PREVENTION

SQL Injection Attack (SQLIA) is a type of code injection technique that threatens confidentiality, integrity, and availability of web databases. The attacker mostly exploits incorrectly filtered user inputs such as text fields in web applications and tries to insert malicious SQL statements into a legitimate query via the vulnerable user input. By doing so, the attacker can access, insert, modify, or delete critical information in a database without proper authorization. In this survey, we describe and categorize types of SQLIA, and analyze existing detection and prevention techniques against such attacks.

**INTRODUCTION**

SQL injection attack is widely used by attackers to gain unauthorized access to systems. This software system is developed to prevent unauthorized access to system using SQL injection attacks. This is done by adding unique value and a signature based authentication technique to verify authenticity. SQL injection is a major security issue these days that allows an attacker to gain access of a web system or application exploiting certain vulnerabilities. This method exploits various web application parameters such as transmitting the traveling form data parameters with an efficient integration of amino acid codes aligned in it. In other words, this software project puts forth a method to analyze and detect the malicious code to find out and prevent the attack. It uses an alternative algorithm for signature based scanning method; this method is based on a different divide and conquers strategy that detects attacks based on various time/space parameters. This innovative system has proved successful in preventing various SQL injection attacks based on its efficient attack detection strategies. 

**MODULE DESCRIPTION**

Project is divided into following modules 

•	Admin login 

•	User login/Registration 

•	Attack 

**ADMIN LOGIN**
This module includes admin login and certain other features. Admin can see the visiters list. It includes users details along with IP address and login time. 
Prevention: sql injection attacks are prevented by providing particular format for username. Brute force attack and DDos attacks are also prevented by blocking login after a particular number of trial. 
 
**USER LOGIN/REGISTRATION** 
In this module a new user can register by submitting the  registration form. User can further login whenever required. 
 
**ATTACK** 
sql injection attacks are done using Select , insert and delete queries.

**CONCLUSION**

The internet applications that make use of the database system face challenges in terms of security and protection of private data . It is important to know how to identify and remediate SQL injection vulnerabilities because the vast majority of data breaches are due to poorly coded web applications. Any code that constructs SQL statements should be reviewed for SQL injection vulnerabilities since a database server will execute all queries that are syntactically valid. Sql Injection Detection And Prevention System provides security by preventing sql injection attacks. This system also further prevents BruteForce attacks and DDos attacks.
